## Solution
### Frontend
In where is waldo project in The Odin Project .
I use html canvas for displaying the image .
After that I add event listener to get the position of mouse 
and sent the position in the backend using fetch API.
### Backend
In the backend after I receive a request . I can start and end the timer .
I can also validate if the data is in the right position (the character in where is waldo)
